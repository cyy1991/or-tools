# Dotnet Core examples
The following examples showcase how to use OrTools.
The project solution has examples for both C# and F#.

We recommend that all projects you create target `netcoreapp2.1`,
as this allows you to compile for various frameworks and
keep up-to-date with the latest frameworks.

Wherever you have or-tools installed, be sure to `PackageReference` the `Google.OrTools`
from the project file.

## Execution
Running the examples will involve compiling them, then running them. You can run the following command:
```bash
dotnet run --project examples/dotnet/<example>.csproj
```
